## Motivate the issue and why AI/ML is needed

* Technology is growing, virtual spaces are expanding. One step of this curve is to make the technology accessible to everybody along with them being faster, smarter, smaller and energy efficient. 
* We are embodying the virtual and overlaying them into our physical spaces and laminating our reality with a theme of co-existence and co-evolution. 
* As we investigate the previous examples showed in class of how machines are tied to a particular area, in industrial sector, where their patterns are choreographed. We understand that the huge pound of steel is quite dangerous to work around with.
* But on the other side we look at the jump towards growth of robotics through Boston Robotics works & how AI is incorporated in them. We look at the examples of Tesla's self-driving, decision taking vehicles. Smart-assistants, cleaning robots, robots that cook, robotics in the farming are among the simpler examples that have been and are becoming a part in our society. 
* Such path makes us believe that it is inevitable to completely leave machines and go down a different trajectory. We can only move forward, and if the decision is to live amongst synthetic beings that the next step is and will be make them compatible to live with.  
* AI is proving to be developing the capabilities of intelligence. They are solving tasks which were once only proven to be dominated by humans. 
* Intelligent Machines proves that they potentially can become a part in our society. If that is the scenario it is important for interested people to learn the process of how and what it takes to make the machine intelligent.
* Easy access to models lets us explore the possibilities of different approaches by machine.
* Our idea consists of building up a scenario with a character inside the virtual space(unity game engine). The space represents the real world, and the character represents the embodied machine. 
* The machine is given a task to locate an object in the environment. 
* We have made use of three different libraries of Machine Learning. One is a Coco-ssd library which detects object in a latent space, Speech Recognizer with which we can access voice library and give commands to our character and the third is Teachable Machine's Image Recognition library. 
* Different libraries commands different actions of the machine. They helps the machine guide its way to complete the given task but with a human interference. 
* The purpose here is that machines will take part in our daily lives and we will also take benefits of its inhumane strength, speed, sightedness but to achieve those activities and still make them suitable to exist amongst us we need AI to be developed for them to think critically and ML can help achieve those tasks.
