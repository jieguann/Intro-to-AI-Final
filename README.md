## Motivate the issue and why AI/ML is needed

* Technology is growing, virtual spaces are expanding. One step of this curve is to make the technology accessible to everybody along with them being faster, smarter, smaller and energy efficient. 
* We are embodying the virtual and overlaying them into our physical spaces and laminating our reality with a theme of co-existence and co-evolution. 
* As we investigate the previous examples showed in class of how machines are tied to a particular area, in industrial sector, where their patterns are choreographed. We understand that the huge pound of steel is quite dangerous to work around with.
* But on the other side we look at the jump towards growth of robotics through Boston Robotics works & how AI is incorporated in them. We look at the examples of Tesla's self-driving, decision taking vehicles. Smart-assistants, cleaning robots, robots that cook, robotics in the farming are among the simpler examples that have been and are becoming a part in our society. 
* Such path makes us believe that it is inevitable to completely leave machines and go down a different trajectory. We can only move forward, and if the decision is to live amongst synthetic beings that the next step is and will be make them compatible to live with.  
* AI is proving to be developing the capabilities of intelligence. They are solving tasks which were once only proven to be dominated by humans.
